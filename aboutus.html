    <p class="card-text">Turkish Aerospace was incepted under the Ministry of Industry and Technology on June 28, 1973 to reduce Turkey’s foreign dependence in defense industry.
        With the decision to use F-16 aircrafts to meet the Turkish Air Force's fighter aircraft need, Turkish Aerospace was incepted by TAI in 1984 for a period of 25 years as a Turkish-U.S. joint investment company to carry out the manufacture of F-16 aircrafts, integration of on-board systems and flight tests .</p>
