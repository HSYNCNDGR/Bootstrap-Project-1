                <p class="fs-3">The T625 GÖKBEY Utility Helicopter, which can operate effectively in high altitude and high temperature, day and night conditions even in the most challenging climates and geographies, is designed and manufactured using national resources and capabilities. Within the scope of the Original Helicopter Program, which was started on the basis of the knowledge, experience and talent pool gained during the ATAK Program, the design and production of critical systems such as transmission, rotor and landing gear, as well as structural and avionic systems, are carried out entirely using national resources.</p>

                    In addition to the flight tests, the endurance, life and damage tolerance tests of the aircraft were carried out successfully on 2 separate structural aircraft. Within the scope of the project, 545 documents were prepared to be sent to EASA and DGCA. All documents for maintenance and maintenance have been prepared. As a result of all these studies, "TT32 Aircraft Type Certificate" was obtained from DGCA on 11 July 2016 for the HÜRKUŞ New Generation Basic Trainer Aircraft. On the same day, EASA's "EASA Validated Type Certificate" and the said Certificate of DGCA were made valid for all European countries. Thus, HÜRKUŞ became the first Turkish aircraft to receive a type certificate from the European Civil Aviation Authority.

                     The Turkish Unmanned Aerial Vehicle designed by the engineers of the Turkish Aerospace in cooperation with several local subcontractors, has left the Hangar with a ceremony held on July 16, 2010 at the Turkish Aerospace facilities after its assembly. Leaving the hangar, ANKA’s engine was also started, and ANKA aims to be the world's best operating system in its category.


                    It is a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) UAV Program. The UAV Program is a development project featuring three aerial vehicle prototypes, aiming to design and develop all ground systems around defined needs and complete the prototype and development tests. The Program features “Conceptual Design", “Preliminary Design and Development” and “Testing and Evaluation” phases. During the development phase, a System Integration Laboratory (SEL) was set up where all systems would be developed/interfaced/integrated.</p>
